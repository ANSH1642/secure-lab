# SecureLab 🛡️💻

**SecureLab** is an intentionally vulnerable web application designed for learning and practicing Web Application Security and Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT). It provides a hands-on environment to explore common security flaws, understand how attackers exploit them, and learn how to implement proper security measures.

## 🔍 Purpose

This project is aimed at:

- Educating developers and students about web vulnerabilities.
- Demonstrating real-world attack scenarios.
- Providing secure solutions alongside each vulnerable component.
- Assisting in security awareness and ethical hacking training.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

**Frontend:**
- React.js
- External CSS (custom, not Tailwind)
  
**Backend:**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MySQL (as the primary database)

**Other Tools:**
